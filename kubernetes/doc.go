This is intended as a high level overview of all kubernetes related code in the WR codebase
and explanation of how it fits together. A general understanding of kubernetes concepts is
assumed, along with an understanding of client-go (https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go).

See the links in the deployment and scheduler controller docs for information on controllers.

Below is a diagram showing the packages each step of the deployment and operation.
It is also the order in which I would recommend reading each package's documentation.

                   +--------------+
                   |client package|
                   +------+-------+
                          ^
                          |
                   +------+------+
                   |kubeDeployCmd|
                   +------+------+
                          |
                          ^
               +----------+----------+
               |deployment controller|
               +----------+----------+
                          |
                          ^
                     +----+-----+
                     |managerCmd|
                     +---+--+---+

| |k8s driver| <---------+  +--------> |scheduling controller| |
| +--+--+----+                         +----------+--+-------+ |

The client package is used by all of the packages to authenticate, and
for interacting with kuberenetes with basic tasks (Create a pod or service,
execute a command in a container or port forwarding)

When a user first starts wr in kubernetes mode the kubeDeployCmd (../cmd/kubernetes.go)
will attempt to connect to a manager on the configured port, if one exists it will terminate.
Then it will configure and deploy wr to a kubernetes cluster. Importantly it reads in a post
creation script if specified. It then checks if it can authenticate against the cluster before
daemonising. The child creates a resource file and rewrites any config files passed to be able
to tar them across to the init container. It then specifies the requested configuration in a
DeployOpts struct, that is passed to the deployment controller, which is then run. It also
generates the options that are passed to the manager command  inside the cluster.

The deployment controller calls Deploy() in  the client package to create the deployment in cluster
and then bootstraps that deployment by copying the requested files. Once complete it starts port forwarding

The manager command contains the options for the k8s driver (../jobqueue/scheduler/kubernetes.go) and scheduling
controller, these are passed through to the driver, where upon calling initialize() the scheduling controller is
started. The scheduling controller and k8s driver together work to implement scheduleri, the interface wr requires
to be satisfied in order to implement a new scheduler.

The overall design is similar to: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator/blob/master/docs/design.md
