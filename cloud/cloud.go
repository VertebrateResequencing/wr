Package cloud provides functions to interact with cloud providers, used to
create cloud resources so that you can spawn servers, then delete those
resources when you're done.

Currently implemented providers are OpenStack, with AWS planned for the future.
The implementation of each supported provider is in its own .go file.

It's a pseudo plug-in system in that it is designed so that you can easily add a
go file that implements the methods of the provideri interface, to support a
new cloud provider. On the other hand, there is no dynamic loading of these go
files; they are all imported (they all belong to the cloud package), and the
correct one used at run time. To "register" a new provideri implementation you
must add a case for it to New() and RequiredEnv() and rebuild. The spawn()
method must create a file at the path sentinelFilePath once the system has
finalised its boot up and is fully ready to use. The system should be configured
to allow user fuse mounts.

Please note that the methods in this package are NOT safe to be used by more
than 1 process at a time.
