This file implements the interval-related code used by CacheTracker.

Standard algorithms exist for merging or querying sets of intervals, eg.
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merging-intervals/ describes the commonly used sort
approach, as well as a reverse sort variant. You can also build an interval
(range) tree or similar.

However, for this particular use case, we expect that most of the time we
will only have between 1 and 3 prior intervals if we merge every time, and we
expect that we will merge the majority of the time.

In this case, a simple nested loop algorithm is 2x faster than blindly sorting
everything each time, and 10x faster than using a tree. The key is to minimise
the number of comparisons that get made; the implementation actually used here
is to simply keep things sorted as they are merged in, and then do as few
comparisons as we can in other methods.

    var ivs Intervals
    for _, data := range inputs {
        iv := NewInterval(int64(data.start), int64(data.length))
        newIvs := ivs.Difference(iv)
        // do something with the new ivs
        ivs = ivs.Merge(iv)
    }
