	Use:   "remove",
	Short: "Remove added commands",
	Long: `You can remove commands you've previously added with "wr add" that
are currently incomplete and not running using this command.

For use when you've made a mistake when specifying the command and it will never
work. If you want to remove commands that are currently running you will need to
"wr kill" them first.

Specify one of the flags -f, -l, -i or -a to choose which commands you want to
remove. Amongst those, only currently incomplete, non-running jobs will be
affected.

-i is the report group (-i) you supplied to "wr add" when you added the job(s)
you want to now remove. Combining with -z lets you remove jobs in multiple
report groups, assuming you have arranged that related groups share some
substring. Alternatively -y lets you specify -i as the internal job id reported
during "wr status".

The file to provide -f is in the format taken by "wr add".

In -f and -l mode you must provide the cwd the commands were set to run in, if
CwdMatters (and must NOT be provided otherwise). Likewise provide the mounts
options that was used when the command was added, if any. You can do this by
using the -c and --mounts/--mounts_json options in -l mode, or by providing the
same file you gave to "wr add" in -f mode.

Note that you can't remove a job that has other jobs depending upon it, unless
you also remove those jobs at the same time. If there is a mistake in the
command line of a job with dependants, you can either:
1) use the -f option to remove all the incomplete jobs you added, fix the
   command line of the bad job by editing the -f file, then use "wr add" to add
   all the jobs back again with the corrected -f file
-or-
2) use the "wr mod" command to modify the command line of the bad job while
   leaving those jobs that are dependant upon it intact.`,
