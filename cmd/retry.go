have since failed and become "buried" using this command.

Specify one of the flags -f, -l, -i or -a to choose which commands you want to
retry. Amongst those, only currently buried jobs will be affected.

The file to provide -f is in the format cmd\tcwd\tmounts, with the last 2
columns optional.

In -f and -l mode you must provide the cwd the commands were set to run in, if
CwdMatters (and must NOT be provided otherwise). Likewise provide the mounts
JSON that was used when the command was added, if any. You can do this by using
the -c and --mounts options, or in -f mode your file can specify the cwd and
mounts, in case it's different for each command.`,
