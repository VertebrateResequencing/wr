	Use:   "retry",
	Short: "Retry failed commands",
	Long: `You can retry commands you've previously added with "wr add" that
have since failed and become "buried" using this command.

Specify one of the flags -f, -l, -i or -a to choose which commands you want to
retry. Amongst those, only currently buried jobs will be affected.

-i is the report group (-i) you supplied to "wr add" when you added the job(s)
you want to now retry. Combining with -z lets you retry jobs in multiple report
groups, assuming you have arranged that related groups share some substring.
Alternatively -y lets you specify -i as the internal job id reported during
"wr status".

The file to provide -f is in the format taken by "wr add".

In -f and -l mode you must provide the cwd the commands were set to run in, if
CwdMatters (and must NOT be provided otherwise). Likewise provide the mounts
options that was used when the command was added, if any. You can do this by
using the -c and --mounts/--mounts_json options in -l mode, or by providing the
same file you gave to "wr add" in -f mode.`,
