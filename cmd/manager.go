	Use:   "manager",

	Long: `The workflow management system.

The wr manager works in the background, doing all the work of ensuring your
commands get run successfully.

It maintains both a temporary queue of the commands you want to run, and a
permanent history of commands you've run in the past, along with a simple
key/val database that can be used to store result metadata associated with
output files. As commands are added to the queue, it makes sure to spawn
sufficient 'wr runner' agents to get them all run.

You'll need to start this daemon with the 'start' sub-command before you can
achieve anything useful with the other wr commands. If the background
process that is spawned when you run this dies, your workflows will become
stalled until you run the 'start' sub-command again.

If the manager fails to start or dies unexpectedly, you can check the logs which
are by default found in ~/.wr_[deployment]/log.

If using the openstack scheduler, note that you must be running on an openstack
server already. Be sure to set --local_username to your username outside of the
cloud, so that resources created are only accessible to you. Instead you can use
'wr cloud deploy -p openstack' to create an openstack server on which wr manager
will be started in openstack mode for you.`,
