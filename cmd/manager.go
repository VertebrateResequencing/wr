// managerCmd represents the manager command
var managerCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "manager",
	Short: "Workflow manager",
	Long: `The workflow management system.

The wr manager works in the background, doing all the work of ensuring your
commands get run successfully.

It maintains both a temporary queue of the commands you want to run, and a
permanent history of commands you've run in the past. As commands are added to
the queue, it makes sure to spawn sufficient 'wr runner' agents to get them all
run.

You'll need to start this daemon with the 'start' sub-command before you can
achieve anything useful with the other wr commands.

If the background process that is spawned when you run this dies, any commands
from your workflows that were running at the time will continue to run. If
they're still running when you start the manager again, the new manager will
pick them up and things will continue normally. If they finish running while the
manager is dead, you have 24hrs to start the manager again; if you do so then
their completed state will be recorded and things will continue normally. If
more than 24hrs pass, however, the fact that the commands completed will not be
known by the new manager, and they will eventually appear in "lost contact"
state. You will have to then confirm them as dead and retry them from the start
(even though they had actually completed).`,
}

// start sub-command starts the daemon
var managerStartCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "start",
	Short: "Start workflow management",
	Long: `Start the workflow manager, daemonizing it in to the background
(unless --foreground option is supplied).

If the manager fails to start or dies unexpectedly, you can check the logs which
are by default found in ~/.wr_[deployment]/log.

To use the openstack scheduler, see 'wr cloud deploy -h' for the details of
which environment variables you need to use. That help also explains some of the
--cloud* options in further detail.

If using the openstack scheduler, note that you must be running on an OpenStack
server already. Be sure to set --local_username to your username outside of the
cloud, so that resources created will not conflict with anyone else in your
tenant (project) also running wr. When wr creates worker instances, they will
automatically use the same networks as the manager's server. The first network
attached to workers will be the one that matches the --cloud_cidr, and the
default (if any) and a custom security group will be applied. If there are any
other networks, they will also be attached to the worker instances, but with no
security groups.

Instead of creating your own openstack network and instance to start the
manager on, you can use 'wr cloud deploy -p openstack' to create an OpenStack
server on which wr manager will be started in OpenStack mode for you. 

Similarly, If using the Kubernetes scheduler you must already be running in a
pod. Be sure to pass a namespace for wr to use that will not have another wr
user attempting to use it.
Instead it is recommended to use 'wr k8s deploy' to bootstrap wr to a cluster.

The --use_cert_domain option is intended for use when you have configured your
own security certificates and want the manager to be reachable at a given
domain name, because there is a risk of the manager's server going down and you
want to be able to bring a new server up (at potentially a different IP address)
and have clients on other servers be able to reconnect to the new manager (after
you set the domain to point to the new manager's server's IP).

If you want to start multiple managers up in different OpenStack networks that
you've created yourself, note that --local_username will need to be globally
unique, since it is used to name the private key that will be created in
OpenStack, and if a key with that name already exists, the manager will not be
able to create a new one (or get the existing one), and so will not function
fully.`,
