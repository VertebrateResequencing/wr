	Use:   "kill",
	Short: "Kill running commands",
	Long: `You can kill commands you've previously added with "wr add" that
are currently running using this command.

After killing commands, there will be a delay before the commands "realise" they
have been killed and actually stop running. At that point they will become
buried and you can "wr remove" them if desired.

Specify one of the flags -f, -l, -i or -a to choose which commands you want to
remove. Amongst those, only running jobs will be affected. If the --confirmdead
option is specified, only "lost contact" jobs will be affected.

-i is the report group (-i) you supplied to "wr add" when you added the job(s)
you want to now kill. Combining with -z lets you kill jobs in multiple report
groups, assuming you have arranged that related groups share some substring.
Alternatively -y lets you specify -i as the internal job id reported during
"wr status".

The file to provide -f is in the format taken by "wr add".

In -f and -l mode you must provide the cwd the commands were set to run in, if
CwdMatters (and must NOT be provided otherwise). Likewise provide the mounts
options that was used when the command was added, if any. You can do this by
using the -c and --mounts/--mounts_json options in -l mode, or by providing the
same file you gave to "wr add" in -f mode.`,
