// cloudCmd represents the cloud command
var cloudCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "cloud",
	Short: "Cloud infrastructure creation",
	Long: `Cloud infrastructure creation.

To run wr in the cloud, you need to create at least 1 cloud server with certain
ports open so that you can start running "wr manager" on it. From there the
manager will run your commands on additional servers spawned as demand dictates.

The cloud sub-commands make it easy to get started, interact with that remote
manager, and clean up afterwards.`,
}

// deploy sub-command brings up a "head" node in the cloud and starts a proxy
// daemon to interact with the manager we spawn there
var cloudDeployCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "deploy",
	Short: "Deploy a manager to a cloud server",
	Long: `Start up 'wr manager' on a cloud server.

Deploy creates all the necessary cloud resources (networks, keys, security
profiles etc.) and starts a cloud server, on which 'wr manager' is run. In a
production deployment the remote manager will use a copy of the latest version
of the wr database, taken from your S3 db backup location, or if you don't use
S3, from your local filesystem.

Deploy then sets up ssh forwarding in the background that lets you use the
normal wr command line utilities such as 'wr add' and view the wr website
locally, even though the manager is actually running remotely. Note that this
precludes starting wr manager locally as well. Also be aware that while 'wr add'
normally associates your current environment variables and working directory
with the cmds you want to run, with a remote deployment the working directory
defaults to /tmp, and commands will be run with the non-login environment
variables of the server the command is run on.

The --script option value can be, for example, the path to a bash script that
you want to run on any created cloud server before any commands run on them. You
might install some software for example. Note that the script is run as the user
defined by --username; if necessary, your bash script may have to prefix its
commands with 'sudo' if the command would only work as root user. Also, there is
a time limit of 15 mins for the script to run. If you're installing lots of
software, consider creating a new image instead, and using the --os option.

The --config_files option lets you specify comma separated arbitrary text file
paths that should be copied from your local system to any created cloud servers.
Absolute paths will be copied to the same absolute path on the server. For files
that should be transferred from your home directory to the cloud server's home
directory (which could be at different absolute paths), prefix your path with
"~/". If the local path of a file is unrelated to the remote path, separate the
paths with a colon to specify source and destination, eg.
"~/projectSpecific/.s3cfg:~/.s3cfg".
Local paths that don't exist are silently ignored.
This option is important if you want to be able to queue up commands that rely
on the --mounts option to 'wr add': you'd specify your s3 config file(s) which
contain your credentials for connecting to your s3 bucket(s).

The --max_local_cores and --max_local_memory options specify how much of the
cloud server that runs wr manager itself should also be used to run commands.
To have an uncontended manager, you could set --max_local_memory to 0, and wr
will run all commands on additional spawned cloud servers. If you don't set
--max_local_memory to 0, but do set --max_local_cores to 0, up to four 0-core
jobs will be allowed to run on the manager's server, but nothing else will. This
is useful if you don't want to waste resources or spend time spawning servers to
run trivial commands that complete near instantly.

The --on_success optional value is the path to some executable that you want to
run locally after the deployment is successful. The executable will be run with
the environment variables WR_MANAGERIP and WR_MANAGERCERTDOMAIN set to the IP
address of the cloud server that wr manager was started on and the domain you
configured as valid for your own TLS certificate respectively. Your executable
might be, for example, a bash script that updates your local DNS entries.

The --set_domain_ip option is an alternative to --on_success if your DNS is
managaged with infoblox. You will need the environment variables INFOBLOX_HOST,
INFOBLOX_USER and INFOBLOX_PASS set for this option to work. After a successful
deployment infoblox will be used to first delete all A records for your
configured WR_MANAGERCERTDOMAIN (which can't be localhost), and then create an
A record for WR_MANAGERCERTDOMAIN that points to the IP address of the cloud
server that wr manager was started on.

The --flavor_sets option lets you describe how flavors relate to hardware in
your cloud setup, and is probably only relevant to private clouds such as
OpenStack, where hardware is limited. If some flavors can only be created on a
subset of your hardware, and other flavors can only be created on a different
subset of your hardware, then you should describe those flavors as being in
different sets, using the form f1,f2;f3,f4 where f1 and f2 are in the same set
and f3 and f4 are in a different set (these names are treated as regular
expressions). Doing this will result in the following behaviour: a flavor in the
first set in your list (that matches your --flavor regex and is suitable for the
job) will be picked, but if a server of that flavor can't be created due to lack
of hardware, then a flavor from the next set in your list will be picked and
tried instead. If there is a lack of hardware in all sets, the first is tried
again.

Deploy can work with any given --os OS image because it uploads wr to any server
it creates; your OS image does not have to have wr installed on it. The only
requirements of the OS image are that it support ssh and sftp on port 22, and
that it be a 64bit linux-like system with /proc/*/smaps, /tmp and some local
writeable disk space in the home directory. For --mounts to work, fuse-utils
must be installed, and /etc/fuse.conf should already have user_allow_other set
or at least be present and commented out (wr will enable it).

The openstack provider needs these environment variables to be set:
OS_AUTH_URL, OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD and OS_REGION_NAME.
You will need additional environment variables, but these depend on the version
of OpenStack you're using. Older installs may need:
OS_TENANT_ID, OS_TENANT_NAME
Newer installs may need:
OS_PROJECT_ID, OS_PROJECT_NAME, and one of OS_DOMAIN_ID (aka
OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID) or OS_DOMAIN_NAME (aka OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME)
Depending on the install, one of OS_TENANT_ID and OS_PROJECT_ID is required. You
might also need OS_USERID.
You can get the necessary values by logging in to your OpenStack dashboard web
interface and looking for the 'Download Openstack RC File' button. For older
installs this is in the Compute -> Access & Security, 'API Access' tab. For
newer installs it is under Project -> API Access.
Finally, you may need to add to that RC file OS_POOL_NAME to define the name
of the network to get floating IPs from (for older installs this defaults to
"nova", for newer ones it defaults to "public").
If you're concerned about security, you can immediately 'unset OS_PASSWORD'
after doing a deploy. (You'll need to set it again before doing a teardown.)

Note that when specifying the OpenStack environment variable 'OS_AUTH_URL', it
must work from within an OpenStack server running your chosen OS image. For
http:// urls, this is most likely to succeed if you use an IP address instead of
a domain name. For https:// urls you'll need a domain name, and will have to
ask your administrator for the appropriate --network_dns settings (or clouddns
config option) to use; the DNS must be able to resolve the domain name from
within OpenStack.`,
