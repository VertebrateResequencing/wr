	// Cwd if CwdMatters, otherwise it will be the parent of the Job's actual
	// working directory.
	CacheBase string `json:",omitempty"`

	// Retries is the number of retries that should be attempted when
	// encountering errors in trying to access your remote S3 bucket. At least 3
	// is recommended. It defaults to 10 if not provided.

	// your Mount. It's a slice to allow you to multiplex different buckets (or
	// different subdirectories of the same bucket) so that it looks like all

	// variables to determine the scheme, domain, region and authentication
	// details to connect to S3 with. All possible sources are checked to fill
	// in any missing values from more preferred sources.
	//
	// The preferred file is ~/.s3cfg, since this is the only config file type
	// that allows the specification of a custom domain. This file is Amazon's
	// s3cmd config file, described here: http://s3tools.org/kb/item14.htm. wr
	// will look at the access_key, secret_key, use_https and host_base options
	// under the section with the given Profile name. If you don't wish to use
	// any other config files or environment variables, you can add the non-
	// standard region option to this file if you need to specify a specific
	// region.
	//
	// The next file checked is the one pointed to by the
	// $AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE environment variable, or ~/.aws/credentials.
	// This file is described here:
	// http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-
	// started.html. wr will look at the aws_access_key_id and
	// aws_secret_access_key options under the section with the given Profile
	// name.
	//
	// wr also checks the file pointed to by the $AWS_CONFIG_FILE environment
	// variable, or ~/.aws/config, described in the previous link. From here the
	// region option is used from the section with the given Profile name. If
	// you don't wish to use a ~/.s3cfg file but do need to specify a custom
	// domain, you can add the non-standard host_base and use_https options to
	// this file instead.
	//
	// As a last resort, ~/.awssecret is checked. This is s3fs's config file,
	// and consists of a single line with your access key and secret key
	// separated by a colon.
	//
	// If set, the environment variables $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
	// $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION override corresponding
	// options found in any config file.

	// Path (required) is the name of your S3 bucket, optionally followed URL-
	// style (separated with forward slashes) by sub-directory names. The
	// highest performance is gained by specifying the deepest path under your
	// bucket that holds all the files you wish to access.

	// Cache is a boolean, which if true, turns on data caching of any data
	// retrieved, or any data you wish to upload.

	// CacheDir is the local directory to store cached data. If this parameter
	// is supplied, Cache is forced true and so doesn't need to be provided. If
