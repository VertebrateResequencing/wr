Package scheduler lets the jobqueue server interact with the configured job
scheduler (if any) to submit jobqueue runner clients and have them run on a
compute cluster (or local machine).

Currently implemented schedulers are local, LSF, OpenStack and Kubernetes. The
implementation of each supported scheduler type is in its own .go file.

It's a pseudo plug-in system in that it is designed so that you can easily add a
go file that implements the methods of the scheduleri interface, to support a
new job scheduler. On the other hand, there is no dynamic loading of these go
files; they are all imported (they all belong to the scheduler package), and the
correct one used at run time. To "register" a new scheduleri implementation you
must add a case for it to New() and rebuild.

    req := &scheduler.Requirements{RAM: 300, Time: 2 * time.Hour, Cores: 1}
    err = s.Schedule("myWRRunnerClient -args", req, 24)
    // wait, and when s.Busy() returns false, your command has been run 24 times
