This file implements the interval-related code used by NewCachedFile to
track which byte intervals have already been downloaded.

Generally more efficient algorithms exist for merging or querying sets of
intervals, eg. http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merging-intervals/ describes the
commonly used sort approach, as well as a reverse sort variant. You can also
build an interval (range) tree or similar.

However, for this particular use case, we expect that most of the time we
will only have between 1 and 3 prior intervals if we merge every time, and we
expect that we will merge the majority of the time.

In this case, the simple nested loop algorithm used here is significantly faster
than the other options (2x faster than sorting, 10x faster than a tree).

    var ivs Intervals
    for _, data := range inputs {
        iv := NewInterval(int64(data.start), int64(data.length))
        newIvs := ivs.Difference(iv)
        // do something with the new ivs
        ivs = ivs.Merge(iv)
    }
